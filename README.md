## RAG System Architecture

The Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system intelligently selects books and places based on multiple factors:

### Book Selection Algorithm
- **Keyword Analysis**: Matches user input with book themes and genres
- **Mood Categorization**: Maps emotional state to appropriate book categories
- **AI Enhancement**: Uses additional AI analysis for better contextual matching
- **Scoring System**: Ranks books based on relevance to user input
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Ensures recommendations even if keyword matching fails

### Place Selection Algorithm
- **Activity Matching**: Suggests places based on mentioned activities or preferences
- **Mood-Based Filtering**: Recommends locations appropriate for current emotional state
- **Contextual Analysis**: Considers user's specific needs and situation
- **Geographic Relevance**: Includes diverse locations suitable for different moods
- **Activity Categorization**: Matches place types with therapeutic activities

### RAG Implementation Details
- **Enhanced Input Processing**: Uses OpenAI to extract additional context and themes
- **Multi-factor Scoring**: Combines keyword matching, mood alignment, and AI insights
- **Intelligent Fallbacks**: Graceful degradation when enhanced analysis fails
- **Real-time Processing**: Efficient selection algorithms for responsive user experience
